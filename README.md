# JWT
JSON Web Tokens, commonly known as JWTs, are tokens that are used to authenticate users on applications. This technology has gained popularity over the past few years because it enables backends to accept requests simply by validating the contents of these JWTS. That is, applications that use JWTS no longer have to hold cookies or other session data about their users. This characteristic facilitates scalability while keeping applications secure.
